	<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken id
	ea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born 
	and I will give you a complete account of the system, 
	and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer 
	f the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. 
	No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
	because it is pleasure ut because those who do not know
	how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
	consequences that are extremely painful. 
	Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or 
	desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, 
	but because occasionally circumstances occur in which
	toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
	To take a trivial example, which of us ever
	undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to  <a href="#" class="read">read more...</a></p>
